Maltego Project
===============
This is a project exploring the open-source intelligence tool Maltego. This is a bit of a documentation of a learning experience and includes a variety of Python files for users to get up and running with the tool. Included is a template file for local transforms, some basic penetration testing transforms, and a few basic social engineering transforms to demonstrate the capabilities of Maltego

## Local Transforms:

1. Add a new graph
2. Add new entity type e.g. PersonalTransforms from the Manage tab
3. Add a new local transform from the Manage tab
4. After putting basic info. and linking to created entity type, link to python installation location and directory location

## YouTube Tutorial
[YouTube Tutorial](http://http://youtu.be/5mPVTOFe3E8)
- toy\_xform.py is the basic local transform you're looking for, add it as your own entity type and enjoy experimenting

## Misc. Information:
- Take a look at the other transforms, but be sure to define your entity types when plugging them into Maltego
